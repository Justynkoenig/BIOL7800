## Intoduction 

My name is Justyn Koenig and I am a fist year PhD student in Dr. Mathews lab.

I am going to be studying *Huperzia* and *Phlegmariurus*.  

I moved to **LA** from **Rhode Island**

I am excited to be using R. 

I have an addiction to buying plants. 

```{bash}

```

```{bash engine.path = "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe"}
R --version
```

```{bash}
git --version
```
